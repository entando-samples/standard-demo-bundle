                <p>International Travel Insurance protects you in the event of
                an illness or injury when traveling outside of your country of
                residence. It provides key medical benefits in case of an
                emergency.<br />

                Traveling abroad is an exciting experience, but unpredictable
                illnesses and accidents can happen. Even worse, the resulting
                medical bills can be overwhelming. The level of international
                medical coverage provided by your domestic insurance provider
                can vary greatly depending on your plan, so you may have very
                limited coverage or no coverage at all. A travel medical
                insurance plan can provide the coverage you need.</p>

                <p>Depending on where you travel, you may encounter language and
                currency barriers that prevent you from accessing high-quality
                medical care.<br />

                Traveling unprotected can leave you vulnerable to paying high
                out-of-pocket medical expenses, and navigating a foreign health
                care system without the assistance you need.<br />

                However, with a travel medical insurance plan, you can worry
                less and experience more knowing you have medical coverage and a
                trusted health advisor who can support you in your time of
                need.</p>
